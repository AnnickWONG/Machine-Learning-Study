The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

Handwritten digit recognition is a very basic task in deep learning.

Here, experiment using the keras framework on python. Two models are used to identify it. The first is a fully connected network with two hidden layers, and the second is a convolutional neural network method.
